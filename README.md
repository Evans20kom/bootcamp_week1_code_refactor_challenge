# Bootcamp Week 1 Code Refactoring Challenge

## Description

This is the first challenge of the 16-week front-end development bootcamp. The task involves refactoring code to meet the accessibility criteria of the customer. The refactoring aims are to improve code in order to make it accessible to users, such as using semantic elements, titles, positioning of elements to assist users, etc. The process of completing this project has led me to discover how headlines are meant to be used in an .html file, the use of semantic elements compared to div and span elements, and practice working on git and github. I have also experimenting with changing class names and reducing code without affecting the appearance of the website.
